    INSTRUCTIONS FOR LINE FILE CREATION FOR LBLRTM AND MonoRTM USING LNFL
   
    LNFL now accommodates the 160 character '.par' format adopted for 
    HITRAN_2004. However, the default format for LNFL will remain the 100 
    character format. 
    
    The rationale for this choice is that the vibrational data as stored in the
    100 character format is more amenable to utlization in LBLRTM, particularly
    for LBLRTM Non-LTE calculation than that associated with the 160 character 
    format for which the vibrational information had been expanded to 
    facilitate association of the lines with the quantum mechanical 
    vibrational designations.
   
    The capability to accomodate the 160 character format is restricted
    to TAPE1. The TAPE2 files should be in 100 character format - you can 
    generate this from the 160 character format by running LNFL with the 
    160 cahacter file as TAPE1, and then use the 100 character TAPE7 file 
    that LNFL produces as the TAPE2 for your next run.

    Note 1: To facilitate the change to HITRAN2004, some of the LNFL flags
    on Record 3 in older releases have been distributed to Records 3 and 4.  
    On Record 3, the flags include those that are general for the LNFL run and 
    those that are relevant to TAPE1.  On Record 4, the flags include those 
    relevant to TAPE2 only.

    Note 2: The default for blocking has been changed.  No blocking is now the 
    default. Flags NBLK1 and NBLK2 are no longer necessary and are ignored.

    Note 3. The writing of internally stored line coupling information to TAPE2
    is no longer supported.  Line coupling information may be included 
    explicitly on TAPE1 or TAPE2 by the user.

    Note 4. As of Dec. 2013, LNFL requires additional broadening parameter
    input files. These files are listed below, and example files are included 
    in the LNFL package. These files are only needed and used if you set the 
    flag 'IBRD' in your TAPE5.

    Note 5. As of Jan. 2015, LNFL allows you to specify the name of
    the ASCII line file at the command line rahter than having to link it
    to TAPE1. For example, if you wanted to use aer_v_4.0 as your ASCII line 
    file you could type: 'lnfl_v3.0_linux_pgi_sgl aer_v_4.0'

    FILE ASSIGNMENTS FOR LNFL

       TAPE1    ASCII LINE FILE (e.g., HITRAN database)
                NOTE: Special reduced microwave ASCII line files, 
                corresponding to the old "spectral_lines.dat" of MonoRTM v4.2, 
                are provided to be used as the TAPE1 inputs of MonoLNFL in 
                the microwave.
  
                The calculational accuracy of these reduced line lists at any 
                frequency between 0 and 899.4 GHz (0-30 cm-1) with respect to 
                the corresponding full line list (aer_v_3.3) is:
                   - spectral_lines.dat.0_55.v5.0_fast: 0.1 K upwelling, 
                                                        0.2 K downwelling  
                   - spectral_lines.dat.0_55.v5.0_veryfast: 0.5 K upwelling, 
                                                            1.0 K downwelling

                A special reduced near IR ASCII line file for the ASCENDS 
                region (6300-6700 cm-1) containing the first 7 HITRAN 
                molecules is also included (spectral_lines.dat.6300_6700.v5.0).
                These line parameters are consistent with aer_v_3.2 
                and aer_v_3.3 (which are indentical for wavenumbers 
                greater than 55 cm-1).See files headers and MonoRTM v5.0 
                relase notes for more details.

                Users who wish to run MonoRTM v5.0 in other spectral regions 
                should use the full AER line file (aer_v_4.0), with a caution
                that the full line file can take a long time to run.
        
       TAPE2    Supplemenatry ASCII Line File to be merged with TAPE1
                MUST be in older 100 character HITRAN format

       TAPE3    BINARY OUTPUT FILE (input for LBLRTM and MonoRTM)

       TAPE5    LNFL INPUT FILE (see below)  
  
       TAPE6    LOG FILE

       TAPE7    ASCII OUTPUT FILE (ascii version of TAPE3 in older 100 
                                   character HITRAN format, does not
                                    include extra broadening parameters)

       co2_co2_brd_param -> CO2 self broadening parameters (input)

       co2_h2o_brd_param -> CO2 transitions broadened by H2O (input)

       o2_h2o_brd_param  -> O2 transitions broadened by H2O (input)

       wv_co2_brd_param  -> H2O transitions broadened by CO2 (input)

       spd_dep_param     -> Speed-dependent Voigt parameters (input)
                               Note that LBLRTM ignores the speed 
                               dependence parameters, but they are used by 
                               MonoRTM v5.0 and later.
