LNFL_v3.1

Jul., 2017

*Added capability to read in the temperature dependence of the self widths and the self pressure shift for O2.


LNFL_v3.0.1 

Feb, 2017

* LNFL v3.0.1 only includes a bug fix to LNFL_v3.0, where the number of lines allowed 
  in the extra broadening parameter files has been increased from the previous limit of 135,000.

LNFL_v3.0

Feb., 2016

* LNFL_v3.0 is an update to MonoLNFL_v1.0 (see below) that includes the capability to handle 
  all the transitions in the HITRAN 2012 line file, as well as the extra broadening
  and speed dependent parameters that were included in MonoLNFL_v1.0. 

* LNFL_v3.0 should only be used for: LBLRTM_v12.4 or later versions
                                     MonoRTM_v5.0 or later versions

* LNFL_v3.0 has been updated to handle all 47 molecules in the HITRAN 2012 line list, 
  all of their isotopologues, and all of their vibrational states. MonoLNFL_v1.0 
  and LNFL_v2.6 will not pass many of these lines through to the TAPE3, so only 
  LNFL_v3.0 should be used with HITRAN 2012.

* LNFL_v3.0 now allows the TAPE1 file to be specified at the command line when the 
  lnfl executable is called. See 'run_examples/run_example_infrared/run_lnfl' to
  see how the new functionality works.

MonoLNFL_v1.0

Dec., 2013

* MonoLNFL is an update to LNFL_v2.6 made to include extra broadening and 
  speed-dependent line parameters in the TAPE3 for use in MonoRTM v5.0 and 
  later. LBLRTM v12.2 and earlier versions do not have the capability to use these 
  parameters, so MonoLNFL should ONLY be used for MonoRTM v5.0 and later versions.  

* MonoLNFL_v1.0 now has the capability to read the following files containing 
  extra broadening and speed-dependent line parameters 
  (D. Weisenstein, K. Cady-Pereira, M. Alvarado):
    - co2_co2_brd_param -> CO2 self broadening parameters based on calculations by 
                           R. Gamache of U. Mass. Lowell. 
    - o2_h2o_brd_param  -> O2 transitions broadened by H2O based on Drouin et al. (2013). 
    - co2_h2o_brd_param -> CO2 transitions broadened by H2O based on Sung (2009)
    - wv_co2_brd_param  -> H2O transitions broadened by CO2 based on calculations by 
                           R. Gamache of U. Mass. Lowell. 
    - spd_dep_param     -> Speed-dependent Voigt parameters for CO2 transitions in the bands 
                           68<-1 and 71<-1 (i.e., 30012<-00001 and 30013<-00001) following 
                           Devi et al. (2007a,b).
   These files, with parameters consistent with the line files spectral_lines.dat.0_55.v5.0_fast 
   and aer_v_3.3, are included with the MonoLNFL_v1.0 package.

* Special reduced microwave ASCII line files, corresponding to the old "spectral_lines.dat" of 
  MonoRTM v4.2, are provided to be used as TAPE1 inputs of MonoLNFL in the microwave. (M. Alvarado, 
  E. Mlawer, K. Cady-Pereira). 
  
  The calculational accuracy of these reduced line lists at any frequency between 0 and 
  899.4 GHz (0-30 cm-1) with respect to the corresponding full line list aer_v_3.3 is:
    - spectral_lines.dat.0_55.v5.0_fast (corresponds to ISPD=0 in MonoRTM v4.2 and older): 
             0.1 K for upwelling, 0.2 K for downwelling  
    - spectral_lines.dat.0_55.v5.0_veryfast (corresponds to ISPD=1 in MonoRTM v4.2 and older): 
             0.5 K for upwelling, 1.0 K for downwelling  

* A special reduced near IR ASCII line file for the ASCENDS region (6300-6700 cm-1) containing
  the first 7 HITRAN molecules is also included (spectral_lines.dat.6300_6700.v5.0). These line parameters
  are consistent with aer_v_3.2 and aer_v_3.3 (which are indentical for wavenumbers greater than 55 cm-1).

LNFL_v2.6

Dec., 2010

* Updated physical constants to be consistent in value and name with LBLRTM
* Fixed minor issues associated with reading F160 line files and handling of default line rejection with coupled lines.
* Simplified makefile system in the build directory; includes new platforms such as Windows and capability to easily add new platforms.
* Updated lnfl_instructions.


LNFL_v2.5

Oct., 2007

Extended the molecule range to include Methanol, CH3OH, HITRAN molecule #39.

LNFL_v2.4

July, 2007

Same as LNFL_v2.3 with an improved directory structure.

LNFL_v2.3

June. 2007

1) The major change in this version is that the internally stored 
line coupling information for oxygen and carbon dioxide is
no longer written to TAPE2 for susequent merging with TAPE1. 

2) Line coupling information must be supplied explicitly by the user,
either on TAPE2 or TAPE1.

3) The meaning of the NOCPL option has been changed such that,
if it is invoked, all line coupling information from TAPE1 or TAPE2
will be suppressed on the output files, TAPE3 (unformatted) 
and TAPE7 (formatted).

4) Some modifiations to the coding have been made for simplification.

5) Upgraded makefiles and corresponding utilities to include more compilers.


LNFL_v2.1

Feb. 2005

1) In the Vib.dat file available for HITRAN2004 no entry exists for the 
   vibrational state ' 2 3 0' for vibrational class 6.

   However, there is a deuterated water vapor line in HITRAN 2004 at 12657.367357 cm-1
   with upper state quantum numbers 2 3 0.

   As an interim measure to address this problem '2 3 0' has been added to 
   the vibrational table for vibrational class 6,  h_vib(6,116), and n_lnvl_v(6)
   has been increased from 115 to 116.  
   (S. A. Clough) 


LNFL_v2.0

Oct.  2004


1) This is the first release of LNFL that accommodates the 160 character format
   adopted for HITRAN_2004.  To facilitate this format change, some of the LNFL flags 
   formerly on Record 3 have now been distributed to Records 3 and 4.  On Record 3,
   the flags include those that are general for the LNFL run and also those that 
   are specific to TAPE1.  On Record 4, the flags include those specific to TAPE2.
   The default format for LNFL will remain the 100 character format.  The rationale
   for this choice is that the vibrational data are more amenable to the LBLRTM Non-LTE
   calculation than those associated with the 160 character format for which the 
   vibrational information had been expanded to facilitate association of the lines
   with the quantum mechanical vibrational designations.

   Note that no blocking for TAPE1 and TAPE2 is now the default, so that flags NBLK1 
   and NBLK2 are now ignored and are not necessary.  They have been replaced with flags
   BLK1 and BLK2 to indicate the respective files  in blocked format.

   A module including for line coupling coefficients is included for use with
   HITRAN2004.  The carnbon dioxide frequencies have been changed in this module
   to be consistent with HITRAN2004 but no other parameters have been modified. 
   In particular, the required constraints on the line coupled bands have NOT been 
   checked.
   
   In this release, the capability to accomodate the 160 character format is restricted
   to TAPE1.

LNFL_v1.15

Oct.2003

1) Added a makefile and utility in order to run LNFL on LINUX INTEL.  
   (M.W. Shephard and H. Nair) 

LNFL_v1.14

Sept.2003

1) The first order line coupling coefficients for oxygen have been scaled 
   by a factor of 0.87.  The second order line coupling coefficients for 
   oxygen have been set to zero.  This is based on the analysis of Cimini 
   et al. using the scanning MWR data from ARM SGP.  
   (K. Cady-Pereira and S.A. Clough))

LNFL_v1.13

Sept. 2003

1) Modified the first isotope from 0 to 1 and the E" to -1. for 
   the first coupled oxygen line in LNFL.

LNFL_v1.12

August 2003

1) Modified LNFL to read over any header information at the top
   of the input spectroscopic line list.

LNFL_v1.11

August 2003

1) Fixed some minor bugs with the total number of molecules that 
   did not get updated when the maximum number was increased to 38.
   (M.W. Shephard)

LNFL_v1.10

August 2003

1) For H2O the lower state energies with value of  -1. have been replaced  
with a value of -300. cm-1 outside of LNFL in the linefile (the negative 
value of the lower state energy indicates that the value is not known).  
This value is modified in the line file to achieve a more probable 
temperature correction.  LNFL has been changed so that it DOES NOT 
change this E" value and passes the -300 directly to LBLRTM.


LNFL_v1.9

August 2003

1) Expanded maximum molecule number up to 38 molecules. 
   (S.A. Clough)
2) Made changes to program to be consistent with TIPS 2002
   inplemented in LBLRTM.
   (S.A. Clough)

LNFL_v1.8

March 2003

1) There was code implemented to report and skip over spectral lines 
   that cannot be handled properly by TIPS in LBLRTM.
    (H. Snell and S.A. Clough)


LNFL_v1.7.1

February 2003

There were only minor changes made to LNFL for version lnfl_v1.7.

1) The revision number in the TAPE6 output comments was updated.

2) To reflect the increase portability of LBLRTM, makefiles and 
   utilities are provided to run LNFL on the following platforms:  


     System     Mfr.        Compiler       sgl
