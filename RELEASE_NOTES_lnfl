LNFL_v1.15

Oct.2003

1) Added a makefile and utility in order to run LNFL on LINUX INTEL.  
   (M.W. Shephard and H. Nair) 

LNFL_v1.14

Sept.2003

1) The first order line coupling coefficients for oxygen have been scaled 
   by a factor of 0.87.  The second order line coupling coefficients for 
   oxygen have been set to zero.  This is based on the analysis of Cimini 
   et al. using the scanning MWR data from ARM SGP.  
   (K. Cady-Pereira and S.A. Clough))

LNFL_v1.13

Sept. 2003

1) Modified the first isotope from 0 to 1 and the E" to -1. for 
   the first coupled oxygen line in LNFL.

LNFL_v1.12

August 2003

1) Modified LNFL to read over any header information at the top
   of the input spectroscopic line list.

LNFL_v1.11

August 2003

1) Fixed some minor bugs with the total number of molecules that 
   did not get updated when the maximum number was increased to 38.
   (M.W. Shephard)

LNFL_v1.10

August 2003

1) For H2O the lower state energies with value of  -1. have been replaced  
with a value of -300. cm-1 outside of LNFL in the linefile (the negative 
value of the lower state energy indicates that the value is not known).  
This value is modified in the line file to achieve a more probable 
temperature correction.  LNFL has been changed so that it DOES NOT 
change this E" value and passes the -300 directly to LBLRTM.


LNFL_v1.9

August 2003

1) Expanded maximum molecule number up to 38 molecules. 
   (S.A. Clough)
2) Made changes to program to be consistent with TIPS 2002
   inplemented in LBLRTM.
   (S.A. Clough)

LNFL_v1.8

March 2003

1) There was code implemented to report and skip over spectral lines 
   that cannot be handled properly by TIPS in LBLRTM.
    (H. Snell and S.A. Clough)


LNFL_v1.7.1

February 2003

There were only minor changes made to LNFL for version lnfl_v1.7.

1) The revision number in the TAPE6 output comments was updated.

2) To reflect the increase portability of LBLRTM, makefiles and 
   utilities are provided to run LNFL on the following platforms:  


     System     Mfr.        Compiler       sgl     
                                         
      IRIX      SGI                       f90
      SOLARIS   SUN                       f90,f77  
      AIX       IBM                       f90      
      LINUX     ----         PGI          f90     
      OS X      Apple        Absoft       f90      
                             g77 (gnu)    g77
